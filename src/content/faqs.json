    "question": "What is a credit builder loan?",
    "answer": "It’s a loan designed to repair/build your credit score. We give you the loan by placing it in an interest generating account with our banking partner. As the loan is paid off we programmatically convert your USD into BTC, held at our BTC custody provider. As the loan is paid off monthly, we report the on-time monthly payment to the 3 main credit bureaus. Showing on-time payment history while supercharging your savings."

    "question": "Is my credit score guaranteed to go up with a credit builder loan?",
    "answer": "In a perfect world, yes. Unfortunately, we can’t guarantee that your credit score will increase throughout the life of the loan. Credit bureaus calculate credit scores by using formulas that consider many factors. Bredit cannot promise that taking out a Credit Builder Plan will increase your credit score because of the potential effects of all the factors, including whether you make all your loan payments on time, your performance on your other credit accounts, and how long your credit accounts have been open. However, payment history is an important component of your credit score and taking out a credit builder plan gives you the opportunity to add more on-time payments to your credit profile!"

    "question": "What if I am late on a loan payment?",
    "answer": "Missed or late loan payments will be reported to the credit bureaus. If you don’t have a long credit history, one late payment can make a big impact. To avoid paying late, set up automatic payments to use funds from your bank account to pay your credit builder loan. Check to make sure the monthly payment went through, and use calendar reminders as an extra precaution. That said, we understand that life happens. So if you know you will not be able to make a loan payment on time, please contact us as soon as possible so we can help you defer your next payment. "

    "question": "What happens to my credit score if I close my account?",
    "answer": "If you close your credit builder account in good standing, then it will no longer report payment history to the credit bureaus monthly. While we can’t speculate on the exact impact of closing a Credit Builder Account on your credit score, payment history is the most important factor in determining your credit score. Closing early could limit the potential benefit of building payment history to your credit score, and your score could fluctuate. Your completed loan would then be reported as if you’ve paid off the account early and any information reported during the life of the loan will remain on your report."
